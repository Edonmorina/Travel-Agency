### Setting up the local server
Inside the xammp htdocs folder make a folder called `travel_agency_backend` and insert the folders that are located inside `backend` into that folder, change the localhost port to `8066` and start the `Apache` and `MySQL` modules inside the xammp control panel.

To visit the local server:

`localhost:8066/`
